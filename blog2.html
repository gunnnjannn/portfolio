        <h1>Leadership Under Pressure:<br>My Journey Managing IdeaHub 2.0</h1>
        <p class="blog-content">
            Organizing a tech event is one thing—managing its execution is another. IdeaHub 2.0, held under Ignite 7.0, wasn't just another event for me. It was my first real test in leadership, decision-making, and crisis management. Every moment pushed me to lead and think fast. I planned ahead and made quick calls to ensure the event's success.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            <b>Four Weeks of Preparation: Structuring the Event</b><br>
            A month before the event, we started mapping out the structure. With three sponsors and five judges, every detail required meticulous planning. We had:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Two industry professionals</b> judging problem statements made by us.</li>
                <li><b>Two Unstop representatives</b> judging Unstop's problem statement solutions.</li>
                <li><b>One GD Works judge</b> assessing answers to their problem statements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-content">We kicked off with a quiz for the first elimination round. There were 256 teams and over 610 participants on Unstop. Participants had until October 16th to complete it.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            <b>Follow-ups and Shortlisting: Taking Responsibility</b><br>
            On October 17th, just a day before the submissions were due, I called Prit from TechCider's Marketing Core. We reached out to participants who hadn't submitted their PPTs yet. The next day, on October 18th, Kunal, the Head of TechCider, and I looked over the submissions. We picked out the best ones.
            
            This was a defining moment for me. Kunal trusting my judgment was surprising. It motivated me to actively help with shortlisting. It showed that my hard work was noticed. I had fully embraced a leadership role, even as an executive member.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            <b>Final Event Day: Taking Charge of Operations</b><br>
            On <b>October 19th</b>, the real challenge began. The event was structured with multiple judging rooms:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Page 1, Page 2, and Page 3</b> were set up for judges to conduct presentations.</li>
                <li><b>GD Works and Unstop judges attended online</b>, as planned.</li>
                <li><b>Industry professionals judged in person</b>, using the college lab's smart board.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-content">Since participants were from across India, most presentations were virtual. I took charge of volunteer assignments, creating <b>teams of 3-4 volunteers per page.</b> Their job was to make sure teams switched smoothly. They needed to ensure the next team was ready while the current team presented.
            
            Kunal worked with industry professionals. We managed the back end of the event flow. The process had some bumps, but I managed last-minute issues to keep everything on track.</p>
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            <b>Tackling Last-Minute PR Issues</b><br>
            The night before the event, Ignite 7.0's team assigned PR (photography) roles. To my frustration, the team assigned two inexperienced photographers to IdeaHub who hadn't worked the previous day. Given that we were hosting external guests, this oversight was unacceptable.
            
            I didn't escalate the issue. Instead, I used my connections to arrange for PR Photography and two of her top team members to cover the event. This fast decision secured top-notch event coverage. It highlights that effective leadership involves leveraging your network.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            <b>Lessons from IdeaHub 2.0</b><br>
            This event was far from smooth, but the team handled it well. I learned that:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Leadership isn't about waiting for things to go wrong—it's about being ready when they do.</b></li>
                <li><b>Taking initiative is key.</b> If you need to do something, step up and do it.</li>
                <li><b>A strong network can solve problems faster.</b></li>
                <li><b>Sometimes, the best way to prove yourself is to handle things so well that people start relying on you.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-content">
                IdeaHub 2.0 was more than just an event for me. It was an experience that shaped my confidence in event management and leadership. And this was just the beginning.
